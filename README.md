# LabView Oscilloscope and Function Generator
This code concerns an internship carried out at the Measurements Laboratory of the Engineering department of the University of Bologna.
The internship was conducted in the period between March 2022 and June 2022, for a total duration of 150 hours, corresponding to 6 training credits.

The purpose of the activity was to acquire the skills and abilities to ensure the use and mastery of the LabView software in order to create a graphical interface for controlling instruments.
The instrumentation used was a function generator in the DG1022z model by Rigol and an oscilloscope in the MSO58 model by Tektronix.

In the oscilloscope, via software, it must be possible:
  - change the time scale (horizontal axis)
  - modify the voltage scale (vertical axis)
  - determine the acquisition mode (continuous or one shot) - configure the trigger
  - transfer the sequence of acquired points to file.

In the function generator, via software, it must be possible:
  - select the type of waveform function
  - modify the amplitude
  - modify the DC offset
  - modify the frequency
  - enable the different output channels
